# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
module 7
This analysis showed different result, which included what roles will need to be filled in the near future. We identified the retirement ready employees who also are eligible for the mentorship program for incoming Pewlett Hackard employees.

Deliverable 1 created a table which showed the number of employees born from 1952 to 1995 who were ready for retirement. This table included employee numbers, their first and last names, job title, start date and their annual salary.

Deliverable 2 was created to show mentorship eligibility for those retiring employees. This table included employees numbers, their first and last names, job title, and their from end dates. Employees that were able to be in the mentorship program would have to have a birthdate between the beginning of the year 1965 to the end of the year.
